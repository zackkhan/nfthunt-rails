Bored Ape Yacht Club are one of the latest most traded, speculated, and in-demand collectables on the NFT market. \n\n“#BoredApeYachtClub” as an artwork explores the conversation, suggestion and expectation that every piece is a “Winner”and positioned for short and long term financial gains. \n\nThrough parody, the projects highlights the creation and adoption of a new identity, ownership and attribution of value through complex, contradictory actions and practices. This excitement being the catalyst for the relentless pursuit of the next great project in the current NFT mania – the search for the formula and strategy by artists, buyers and collectors alike.\n\nUsing the concept of a spin of the dice, spin of the wheel or slot machine in a casino as metaphor for the fun, greed and excitement driven by rackless speculation that every roll or spin will result in a “Win” (with high returns). This is coupled with the disregard for the risk (odds of success) and dangers to an artist reputation and their career in such a fast-paced market.  \n\nEvery spin raise the question of what are the odds of getting three (3) 'Bored Apes' to WIN! in the game of wild speculation- aligning to the fact that not every spin (purchase) will result in the outcome of a win and huge financial reward – a metaphor for reminding buyers of the inherit risk of hyper speculation.\n\nTransparent circuit between the background animation and the foreground gaming wheel action suggest and highlight the positive shift in the art and collectables marketplace through a certain level of transparency  provided through easy validation, authentication and sales verification using NFT's on a public blockchain.\n\nCreated by 'The House of Medici' collective a fluid collective within the The Concept Space, the project is inspired by the recent digital art and collectables NFT boom in a new token economy (tokenomics).\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nUnique Added Value to our NFTs\nOur Value Added NFTs are supported by complimentary access and Rights to top ranking hashtags through our collaboration with the Gistmine platform (currently in pre public beta release).
